~       "Venture to Vorti Peaks"


After saving The Earth from the Vorticon threat Billy decided it's time
for a break. But our hero isn't content with just any kind of break.
Billy signed up for a skiing field trip with his fellow classmates.
Just because we're not saving the world it doesn't mean we can't have
a little excitement.
On the bus ride you notice that your arch-nemesis, Mortimer McMire, is
also aboard. After being sneered at for nearly the entire trip you can't
help but to expect some trouble ahead ...

Are you ready to face the slippery slopes and jagged edges of ...

        <<< VORTI PEAKS >>>


~   MOUNTAINEERING GEAR

You woke up from a short nap just as the bus arrived at it's destination.
You noticed that some of your stuff is missing. Who could have done this?
You need to find the following equipment:

	 COMPASS

	 MAP

	 BACKPACK

	 SICKLES


~        THE ADVENTURE BEGINS...

Your task is before you.  Go get 'em, Commander Keen!
